# Issues

I should list these in github because they're current issues with the project, but I'm putting them here for now

### A11y

A11y is broken on my contributor page and my creator page. CircleC should be the first element to receive focus, but it keeps skipping over it and jumping to the actionBar. I tried fixing this by setting a different tabIndex but it still didn't work for me. Clicking somewhere on the page resets it to the proper order. I think this is because of how I set up my circles, but I really don't know why it's doing that. 

Another a11y problem, is that I think my application is going to be impossible for screen reader users to understand.
