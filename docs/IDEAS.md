# Ideas

These are ideas I had for future projects that I came up with during development. I've since lost interest them.

## Charity Application? Unipledge?

When I was brainstorming stuff in the beginning, I thought it would be pretty cool to have a "unipledge" feature that would donate to every creator on the platform (this might create an influx of fake/repeat creators though). I also thought of up with a DeFi charity application, where users could pool their money into different charity pools and have that money locked in a DeFi protocol like [Aave](https://aave.com/), the accrued interest could then go towards a charity address like [the water project @ 0x54a465610d119ad28deafd4bce555834c38beeb9](https://thewaterproject.org/donate-ethereum). Users could then switch their funds to different pools whenever they felt like it, but some of their original contribution would stay in the pool so that it would continue to grow forever.

## Creator pages 

Allow creators to create their own profile page using data pulled from the blockchain.
