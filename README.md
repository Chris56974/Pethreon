# Design Doc

[This dapp](https://github.com/Chris56974/WeiBuddies) (decentralized application) is a modified version of Sergei Tikhomirov et al's ["Pethreon" Smart Contract](https://github.com/s-tikhomirov/pethreon/blob/master/pethreon.sol). It's a crowd funding platform, where users (contributors & creators) can sign in through their cryptowallet to contribute funds to each other in regular intervals. It's made under a mobile first approach using the mockups below (Figma).
