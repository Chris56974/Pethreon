# Overview

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/aad6e818-4a8d-4149-bd89-20bb062c3e2c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lucid-roentgen-95db25/deploys)

[This dapp](https://github.com/Chris56974/Pethreon) is a decentralized crowdfunding application that runs on ethereum. It's similar to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) except there aren't any third-parties involved. The backend is a modified version of [Sergei's Pethreon Smart Contract](https://github.com/s-tikhomirov/pethreon), and the frontend is my own react project.

## Backend

- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
  - programming language for creating smart contracts (programs that run on ethereum)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
  - dev blockchain for running smart contracts locally on your computer
- [Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/)
  - testing library for smart contracts
- [Infura](https://infura.io/)
  - hosting provider for ethereum nodes (~AWS of ethereum)
- [Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain)
  - creates type definitions for my smart contracts so I can get autocomplete in my frontend code

## Frontend

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - library for building client-facing web apps
- [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
  - library for interacting with a smart contract from a frontend
- [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
  - declarative animation library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - superset of javascript

### What does the user flow look like?

In Pethreon, every user is both a "contributor" and a "creator". A user signs into the app using their cryptowallet and is immediately brought to the contributor page. As a contributor, they can deposit money into the pethreon smart contract so that they can then "pledge" it to a creator later. They can choose how long their pledge should last for. They can also cancel their current pledge and be refunded the remaining amount.

A user can navigate to the creator page from the contributor page. There they will find all the money that other users have pledged to them. This means the creator must know about the app in order for them to receive money (unlike a typical ethereum donation). The advantages of using Pethreon are similar to that of Patreon, with a few twists. There is no personal data that you have to give up in order to use the app (besides your ethereum address). There are also no middle-men involved and therefore no commissions or censorship (just gas fees). 

### How does it all work?

I basically have a react app that talks to a remote server @ Infura. This server is special because it's also an "ethereum node", which means it can read and write to the blockchain. My react app talks to this server whenever it wants to do something with the Pethreon smart contract. It doesn't use a library like axios though, it uses a library like ethers.js which communicates over [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC) (a protocol built on top of HTTP). The "RPC" in JSON-RPC refers to the type of calls my react app can make when reaching out to my infura node - contract.example(). And the JSON part refers to the output I get back whenever I compile my [Pethreon.sol](https://github.com/Chris56974/Pethreon/blob/main/packages/backend/contracts/Pethreon.sol) file into a [Pethreon.json](https://github.com/Chris56974/Pethreon/blob/main/packages/backend/deployments/localhost/Pethreon.json) file. The compiler I use is solc which is bundled together with hardhat, and the pethreon.json file it generates has two important pieces of information. It has an EVM "bytecode" which is basically just the smart contract itself (which is the thing I deploy to ethereum), and the "abi" which is basically just an instruction sheet that tells a frontend how it can use the smart contract. The abi lists stuff like all the functions that exist on the smart contract as well as their arguments (i.e. the deposit() takes some ethereum and returns back the current user balance)

Some of those smart contract functions cost real money (like creating a pledge) because they require verification from every other node in the ethereum network ([~6,000 nodes](https://www.ethernodes.org/history) at the time of writing). Others are free (subject to my agreement @ infura -> [I get 100,000 free calls a day](https://infura.io/pricing)) because they don't require any verification from the network (like reading data from the blockchain).

### Misc 

The react app was made under a mobile first approach using [these design mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/dwPfF2lhw84J4PZdZTIQvL/Pethreon?node-id=0%3A1).
